# React Color Picker App

## Description
An app that helps users construct color pallets. 

## Motive
The idea behind making a color pallet app; as a front-end developer, I pick color pallets for most of my projects, and I wanted to understand what goes into making a color pallet app.

## What I Learned 
I learned how to build a React project, learned how to leverage third-party packages to enhance my projects, and I learned how to utilize APIs in a React environment.
